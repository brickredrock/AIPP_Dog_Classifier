1.	Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed?  If not, report the difference in the classifications.
    a.	Yes, I uploaded Pomeranians and it classified them as Pomeranians.
2.	Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as the model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg?  If not, report the differences in the classifications.
    a.	Yes, I uploaded Pomeranians and it classified them as Pomeranians.
3.	Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs?  If not, report the misclassifications.
    a.	I uploaded an American Quarter Horse and a Chevrolet Nova.  Neither of them were classified as dogs.  Although it was interesting to note that the model called the breed “sorrel” which is a color of horse.  The Nova was also noted as either a beach wagon or pickup in the different models.
4.	Based upon your answers for questions 1-3 above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images.  Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
    a.	I would pick the AlexNet model but it was a toss up with VGG16.   ResNet18 was easier to move because it classified the Nova as a pickup while the other two picked a style of vehicle that seemed more applicable (estate car or wagon for both).  There was no noticeable difference between the data that was reported back other than AlexNet was 3 seconds faster in producing results over VGG16.
